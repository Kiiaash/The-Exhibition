# The-Exhibition

For this project, I decided to use object-oriented PHP (OOP PHP) to dive deeper into understanding how object-oriented programming works. With modern frameworks like Laravel, it's not enough to just use themâ€”you need to understand what's happening behind the scenes. This realization drove me to start my own OOP PHP project, following the core principles and strategies of OOP. 

I aimed to build my own way of implementing OOP concepts, which helped me deepen my understanding of the overall architecture and flow of these frameworks. Additionally, I focused on applying polymorphism to make my classes and controllers more flexible and generic. This hands-on experience provided me with an extraordinary level of insight into how frameworks work at their core, enriching my knowledge of OOP and its critical role in building scalable and maintainable web applications.
